# Major WIP

This modpack is based off the old modpack "Crash Landing" - and the others like it

It is going to be mostly technology themed

Things that I need help with:

World generation
Structure generation
Advancement pathways/general know-how/experience on how to make a pack that's balanced as far as that goes
Any help is appreciated in general, as well. I do not know how to write mods, I've written a number of plugins and datapacks, 
but nothing very content-heavy.

If you're up for helping out, don't hesitate to join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/qe3YQrbegA)!

Current structure:

## Base Pack
Mods that will go both in the client and server pack, due to the way I can't manage anything, I'm keeping these in one section

## Client Pack
Mods that are purely client-side, and should not go into the server pack

## Server Pack
Mods that are mainly for multiplayer play, claims, guilds, etc, not core gameplay stuff, server-side required only
